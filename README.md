# Old-Firmware-Downloader
Download firmwares for analysing weaknesses existed inside.

When you download all the files, just start the main.py, and you can download over 9 thousand obsolete firmwares, we use it to detect possible weaknesses inside them.
This is our first project.
Downloaded files will be put in the folder where you put our code into. When you download zip files, we will ask you whether you need to decompress them.
Also, this project can sort those files decompressed from zip files into different suffixes, convenient for us all to find them.

Here are modules need you to install in your python virtual environment:
pip install requests
pip install Zipfile
pip install psycopg2
